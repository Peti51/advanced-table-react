This react app is a powerful tool for displaying and managing a large array of people. It leverages React to provide sorting, filtering, and search capabilities for an enhanced user experience.

With this component, you can easily sort the people based on various criteria. By clicking on the column headers, you can toggle between ascending and descending order, allowing you to organize the data in a way that best suits your needs.

Additionally, the PeoplePage component enables you to filter the displayed people based on different parameters. You can choose to filter by sex, selecting from options such as "All," "Male," or "Female." Moreover, you can narrow down the results by specifying the centuries in which the people were born. The active centuries can be selected or deselected, providing flexibility in exploring the data.

To further enhance usability, the component includes a search functionality. Simply enter a name or keyword in the search bar, and the table will dynamically update to display only the relevant results. This makes it quick and easy to find specific individuals in the large array of people.

The PeoplePage component is designed to handle loading states and error handling, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience for users. Whether you're building an application that requires managing a vast database of people or simply want to showcase a list of individuals, this component provides the necessary tools to efficiently navigate and interact with the data.
