This React app uses modern technologies like React, React Router, and TypeScript to create a powerful tool for managing and displaying a large array of people. It offers sorting, filtering, and search capabilities to enhance the user experience.

The main component, PeoplePage, handles the core functionality of the app. It receives the dataset of people as a prop and manages loading states and error handling.

Within PeoplePage, there are sub-components like PeopleFilters for filtering options and PeopleTable for rendering the people data in a sortable table.

The app includes a search feature, allowing users to search for specific individuals by name or keyword.

The century filter component, FilterCenturies, enables users to filter people based on the centuries they were born in.

Overall, this app leverages React and related technologies to efficiently manage and explore a large array of people with sorting, filtering, and search capabilities.
